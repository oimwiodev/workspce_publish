# Context
Nerfstudio provides a simple API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and testing NeRFs. The library supports a **more interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component.** With more modular NeRFs, we hope to create a more user-friendly experience in exploring the technology.

This is a contributor-friendly repo with the goal of building a community where users can more easily build upon each other’s contributions. Nerfstudio initially launched as an opensource project by Berkeley students in [KAIR lab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/index.html#kair) at [Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in October 2022 as a part of a research project ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04264)). It is currently developed by Berkeley students and community contributors.

We are committed to providing learning resources to help you understand the basics of (if you’re just getting started), and keep up-to-date with (if you’re a seasoned veteran) all things NeRF. As researchers, we know just how hard it is to get onboarded with this next-gen technology. So we’re here to help with tutorials, documentation, and more!

Have feature requests? Want to add your brand-spankin’-new NeRF model? Have a new dataset? **We welcome [contributions](https://docs.nerf.studio/reference/contributing.html)!** Please do not hesitate to reach out to the nerfstudio team with any questions via [Discord](https://discord.gg/uMbNqcraFc).

Have feedback? We’d love for you to fill out our [Nerfstudio Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/sqN5phJN7LfQVwnP9) if you want to let us know who you are, why you are interested in Nerfstudio, or provide any feedback!

We hope nerfstudio enables you to build faster 🔨 learn together 📚 and contribute to our NeRF community 💖.
